Why does LinkedStack not require an explicit constructor? 
An explicit constructor is not needed in this class because the ADT "LinkedList" has been implemented.


What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the LinkedStack methods, as well as ReverseLines.main?
push, peek, pop, isEmpty all equal to O(1) complexity and O(1) space , asList and ReverseLines have O(n) complexity and O(n) space.

How else (not using Node) could we have implemented LinkedStack in such a way that it is still based on a linked 
list but the asList method uses constant time and space? 
We can use an array list instead.

Is it better for push and pop to return the item or the stack itself? 
It is better for push and pop to return the item.
